        <p>We have been making pizza since the innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of tomato as a
            topping.
            For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed
            by many Europeans to be poisonous,
            as some other fruits of the Solanaceae family are. However, by the late 18th century,
            it was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so
            the pizza began.</p>
